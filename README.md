## How it works

This plugin reads in CSV marker files generated by REAPER.
It will then create, or update, an MA2 sequence with the cue names and timecode trigger times of those markers.
If the sequence does not exist, the plugin will create it.
If the sequence exists but is missing cues, these cues will be created.
If the cues already exist, only their timing will be updated.
